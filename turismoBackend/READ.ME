Here's the guideline for Spring Security to function properly:

Spring Security Configuration: Ensure you have configured Spring Security in your Spring application. You can do this using annotations or Java-based configuration, depending on your preference and project structure.

Prepared Database: You need a configured and operational database. In the profile table (profile), make sure you have at least two roles: USER with id = 1 and ADMIN with id = 2.

Example of the profile table:

id	  name   role
1	    any    USER
2	    any    ADMIN
